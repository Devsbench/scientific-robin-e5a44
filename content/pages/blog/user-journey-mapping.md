# Transform Real Estate into Digital Shares.

### Why should you be interested in real estate tokenization?

##### Introduction

Real estate tokenization is an emerging trend representing the convergence of real estate investing and blockchain technology. Tokenization helps asset or fund owners raise capital more efficiently, and gives investors unprecedented access to private real estate investments, transparency, and liquidity.

**The future of real estate investing is fractional.** Fractionalized real estate shares allow investors to purchase pieces (shares) of a building or property. This provides retail investors with the opportunity to invest in commercial real estate without a large initial investment and provide property builders and owners with an additional source of liquidity. Tokenizing real estate has become the focus of many institutions in 2018, and is likely to continue into the future as Ethereum offers a way to add improved levels of liquidity (tokens) to a notoriously illiquid industry (real estate).

Fractional ownership democratizes access to real estate investment, and therefore distributes and minimizes the risks and labor involved with owning property.

Although many individuals and institutions see real estate as an attractive investment alternative, the expensive initial investment creates a significant barrier to entry for the average investor or property builder. Combined with inefficient paper-based and labor-intensive processes, as well as a lack of oversight causes limited participation, liquidity and performance. Making the real estate market accessible to a wider investor base requires improving efficiency in the initial investment process and the ongoing management and administration of property holdings. Issuing real estate tokens on a distributed ledger technology (DLT)-based platform and creating a marketplace for issuers (property owners), investors and other stakeholders may be the solution to taking the real estate market to the next level.

### What are arguments for Real Estate tokenization?

There are at least couple of reasons:

*   **Access to the huge capital stored in crypto world!** As for now (Nov 2021) it is US$3 trillion. Wouldn't it be a great idea that every crypto investor (hodler) now can become your investor? This is an enormous opportunity on the market.

<!---->

*   **Access to investors from different countries.** For example: People from Asia are not allowed to buy properties in Europe for investment purposes (there are local legal regulations that prohibit overseas investment). Escaping to the crypto world is the solution for that. Who wouldn’t want to get access to overseas investors?

<!---->

*   **Fractional investment is finally possible.** Assets can now be divided into smaller amounts of ownership, thanks to tokenization. Like Bitcoin, a real estate token can be divided to make the barrier of entry to smaller investors much easier to overcome. Every investor now can buy a fraction of your property, so far they have to buy at least one flat, one house etc. So, now you will have access to smaller investors who can not afford to invest in your real estate business earlier. Since the transactions will take place in a virtual environment, it also makes it easier to start investing in real estate. Rather than needing legal documents to transfer ownership, someone with little to no experience can make a purchase online. This gives far more people the ability to invest in real estate without going through the daunting legal process of transferring ownership, with which many beginner investors may not be familiar.

*   **Crypto investors are willing to stay with crypto as long as possible** because when they get back to “fiat” currencies they have to pay income tax. Crypto is growing so no one is eager to sell their crypto but investing in your tokens is a great opportunity to multiply their profit. The situation is that: I have a lot of crypto - where can I reinvest them? Why not for your tokenized real estate.

*   **Liquidity of real estate.** The most significant issue with investing and selling real estate is the liquidity of the asset. Tokenization could mitigate this issue. As easy as it is to buy and sell various cryptocurrencies in the marketplace, tokenization could simplify transactions in the real estate space. Rather than the normal transfer of the ownership process that takes place when selling a share of ownership in a real estate investment, tokenization could cut out the middleman and allow ownership to be transferred directly from investor to investor (the same as selling/buying BTC or other crypto tokens)

*   **Build a Centralized Real Estate Tokenization Platform (Marketplace)**. There are many traditional marketplaces (listings) where these assets are available for sale. If the assets were tokenized, they could be listed in one centralized marketplace. It could be your marketplace - why not! Through this possibility, investors will have access to search for potential investments located in other geographical areas and allow sellers to gain access to a large pool of potential buyers. It could be your business opportunity to build this marketplace. 

*   **Transactions high security!** Have you ever heard that blockchain was hacked? No, you haven't. Why? Because it is not possible to hack the blockchain. It means that no one can steal your tokens. Blockchain technology has proven to be extremely secure when treated as currency. This application of the technology will be just as secure as it will be utilizing the same technology to process transactions of investments.

*   **Lower transaction costs.** Blockchain technology platform for exchanging tokens will have the potential to greatly lower transaction costs associated with real estate. Real estate investment funds often come with high minimum investments and upfront fees. Tokens allow investors to buy and sell real estate without incurring the traditional closing costs on real estate, which lead to significantly lower transaction costs.

*   **Automating Processes.** The use of DLT can remove time-consuming reconciliation processes between multiple parties by offering an immutable record of ownership.
