# Transform Real Estate into Digital Shares.

### Why should you be interested in real estate tokenization?

##### Introduction

Real estate tokenization is an emerging trend representing the convergence of real estate investing and blockchain technology. Tokenization helps asset or fund owners raise capital more efficiently, and gives investors unprecedented access to private real estate investments, transparency, and liquidity.

**The future of real estate investing is fractional.** Fractionalized real estate shares allow investors to purchase pieces (shares) of a building or property. This provides retail investors with the opportunity to invest in commercial real estate without a large initial investment and provide property builders and owners with an additional source of liquidity. Tokenizing real estate has become the focus of many institutions in 2018, and is likely to continue into the future as Ethereum offers a way to add improved levels of liquidity (tokens) to a notoriously illiquid industry (real estate).

Fractional ownership democratizes access to real estate investment, and therefore distributes and minimizes the risks and labor involved with owning property.

Although many individuals and institutions see real estate as an attractive investment alternative, the expensive initial investment creates a significant barrier to entry for the average investor or property builder. Combined with inefficient paper-based and labor-intensive processes, as well as a lack of oversight causes limited participation, liquidity and performance. Making the real estate market accessible to a wider investor base requires improving efficiency in the initial investment process and the ongoing management and administration of property holdings. Issuing real estate tokens on a distributed ledger technology (DLT)-based platform and creating a marketplace for issuers (property owners), investors and other stakeholders may be the solution to taking the real estate market to the next level.

### What are arguments for Real Estate tokenization?

There are at least couple of reasons:

*   **Access to the huge capital stored in crypto world!** As for now (Nov 2021) it is US$3 trillion. Wouldn't it be a great idea that every crypto investor (hodler) now can become your investor? This is an enormous opportunity on the market.

<!---->

*   **Access to investors from different countries.** For example: People from Asia are not allowed to buy properties in Europe for investment purposes (there are local legal regulations that prohibit overseas investment). Escaping to the crypto world is the solution for that. Who wouldn’t want to get access to overseas investors?

<!---->

*   **Fractional investment is finally possible.** Assets can now be divided into smaller amounts of ownership, thanks to tokenization. Like Bitcoin, a real estate token can be divided to make the barrier of entry to smaller investors much easier to overcome. Every investor now can buy a fraction of your property, so far they have to buy at least one flat, one house etc. So, now you will have access to smaller investors who can not afford to invest in your real estate business earlier. Since the transactions will take place in a virtual environment, it also makes it easier to start investing in real estate. Rather than needing legal documents to transfer ownership, someone with little to no experience can make a purchase online. This gives far more people the ability to invest in real estate without going through the daunting legal process of transferring ownership, with which many beginner investors may not be familiar.

<!---->

*   **Crypto investors are willing to stay with crypto as long as possible** because when they get back to “fiat” currencies they have to pay income tax. Crypto is growing so no one is eager to sell their crypto but investing in your tokens is a great opportunity to multiply their profit. The situation is that: I have a lot of crypto - where can I reinvest them? Why not for your tokenized real estate.

*   **Liquidity of real estate.** The most significant issue with investing and selling real estate is the liquidity of the asset. Tokenization could mitigate this issue. As easy as it is to buy and sell various cryptocurrencies in the marketplace, tokenization could simplify transactions in the real estate space. Rather than the normal transfer of the ownership process that takes place when selling a share of ownership in a real estate investment, tokenization could cut out the middleman and allow ownership to be transferred directly from investor to investor (the same as selling/buying BTC or other crypto tokens)

*   **Build a Centralized Real Estate Tokenization Platform (Marketplace)**. There are many traditional marketplaces (listings) where these assets are available for sale. If the assets were tokenized, they could be listed in one centralized marketplace. It could be your marketplace - why not! Through this possibility, investors will have access to search for potential investments located in other geographical areas and allow sellers to gain access to a large pool of potential buyers. It could be your business opportunity to build this marketplace. 

*   **Transactions high security!** Have you ever heard that blockchain was hacked? No, you haven't. Why? Because it is not possible to hack the blockchain. It means that no one can steal your tokens. Blockchain technology has proven to be extremely secure when treated as currency. This application of the technology will be just as secure as it will be utilizing the same technology to process transactions of investments.

*   **Lower transaction costs.** Blockchain technology platform for exchanging tokens will have the potential to greatly lower transaction costs associated with real estate. Real estate investment funds often come with high minimum investments and upfront fees. Tokens allow investors to buy and sell real estate without incurring the traditional closing costs on real estate, which lead to significantly lower transaction costs.

*   **Automating Processes.** The use of DLT can remove time-consuming reconciliation processes between multiple parties by offering an immutable record of ownership.

### What is a token? And what is a tokenization?

You can think about tokens as shares of your investment (real estate property). Let's say you want to build a nice condo in Miami and need US$100,000,000 to make it happen. Let’s assume that you will create 100mln tokens, and in the IPO every token will be worth 1 USD.  1 token is equal to 1 USD. It means that I can invest $10,000 buying 10,000 tokens from you and collecting them in my crypto wallet. Simple? Yes, this is very simple and easy to do from a technology point of view. Blockchain technology allows us to do it. 

### How to set up the initial price for your token?

We hear this question very often. What should be the price of my token. To answer this question we have to divide it into two phases:

###### **Phase-1: Token IPO - Initial Public Offer.** Token Pre-Sales

Initial token price will be written in Smart Contract (literally Blockchain Engineer will set it up in the piece of code). And during the IPO phase every investor could buy your token for this price. Let’s make an example calculation:

***Value of the property:** $450,000*

***Amount of tokens you want to issue:** 100,000*

1 Token price: $450,000 / 100,000 = $4,5

###### **Phase-2: Token listed on the crypto exchange.**

At some point you would want to list your token on a public crypto exchange to make it available to a wider space of investors (you can find more details about listing tokens on crypto exchanges later in this article). On crypto exchange the price of your token will follow the market desire. If people start to buy your token, the price will rise (from the initial price). If the people start to sell your token then the price will be low. 

## Step1 - Blockchain

### What is the blockchain?

There are many definitions of the blockchain however we like this one. The blockchain = Think of it as a cloud provider, kinda like AWS, Google, Microsoft but it's owned by no one. It's run by compute power from mining machines all over the world (community). Usually these people are called miners and we **pay (gas)** them to run our code! Simple? Yes! We love to simplify things :-)

### Which blockchain is best for asset tokenization? 

There are a couple of blockchain we can use for tokenization: Ethereum, Tezos, Cardano, Solana, Hyperledger etc. All of these blockchains are featured with **smart contracts** (f.e. Bitcoin blockchain doesn’t have smart contracts - we can’t use it). Smart contracts give the ability to create own tokens. We pick Ethereum as the most advanced and developed blockchain and also very popular. 

Glossary: 

**Gas and fees** - *Gas refers to the unit that measures the amount of computational effort required to execute specific operations on the Ethereum network. F.e. Creating a token, transferring a token between two users (seller and buyer) etc.*

**Miner** - person who uses their time and computation power to process transactions and produce blocks. We have to pay (gas) them to run our code on the blockchain. \*

### What is the token?

A token is a **blockchain-based asset** with similar functionality to bitcoin or ether. It can hold value and be sent and received. It can represent a tradable asset or utility and allows the holder to use it for investment or economic purposes. Tokens can represent virtually anything:

*   reputation points in an online platform

*   skills of a character in a game

*   lottery tickets

*   financial assets like a share in a company

*   a fiat currency like USD

*   an ounce of gold

*   **assets like a share in real estate**

*   equity interest in a legal entity

*   ownership of the collateralized debt

*   and more...

You can also find the name for our token as \*\*security token. \*\*

To summarise once more: Tokens are **essentially digital, liquid contracts for fractions of any asset that already has value**, like real estate, a car, or corporate stock. Using security tokens means investors can expect that their ownership stake is preserved on the blockchain ledger.

### How to ship your own token?

**Coin vs Token. What is the difference? Do we create a coin or a token?** Let’s explain. 

A crypto coin is, so to speak, the main currency on a blockchain. For example, Ether (ETH) is the underlying currency on the most popular blockchain called Ethereum. Every blockchain needs a crypto coin acting as money to fund transactions and any other interactions with a blockchain.

In addition to having coins, advanced blockchains like Ethereum, Tezos, Cardano or Binance Chain, also support tokens (also called cryptotokens). These tokens can be issued by anybody according to a blockchain’s standards. Of course you need to have coding skills to create a **smart contract** which issues a token. 

There are a couple of token standards (marked as ERC-20, ERC-721, ERC-777 and ERC 1155). The most useful and popular for asset tokenization is ERC-20. The ERC-20 introduces a standard for **Fungible Tokens**, in other words, they have a property that makes each Token be exactly the same (in type and value) of another Token. For example, an ERC-20 Token acts just like the ETH, meaning that 1 Token is and will always be equal to all the other Tokens.

*Extra peace of knowledge: You probably heard of Non Fungible Tokens (NFT). Instead of Fungible Tokens, NFT is a way to represent anything unique as an Ethereum-based asset, like a piece of art. Imagine that you have digital certification (token NFT) that proves ownership of Mona Lisa art. There is only one original Mona Lisa and it can only have one official owner.*

So, to tokenize your real estate we have to use Fungible Tokens (ERC20). What else do we need?

### What the heck is a smart contract? Do we need it? 

A **smart contract** is a program (piece of code written by a blockchain developer) that runs in the blockchain network (in our case - Ethereum). Smart contracts will help make tokenization happen.

We have to create a couple of smart contracts. First smart contract will be responsible for token creation and initiation of a token IPO (Initial Public Offering).

Token represents share in your property. Our token will work with wallets and crypto exchanges. You want to have the possibility to transfer and trade your tokens. 

### Token IPO 

An initial public offering (IPO) is a process in which your company sells crypto assets (tokens) of its real estate to the public in new issuance. The process allows your company to raise capital from public investors. This is a very important step because we have to work together to figure out a couple of things. We have to create a new smart contract and set the following parameters inside the contract:

*   We have to create an established **quantity** of tokens (f.e. 1,000,000 tokens)

*   We want to allow **buying tokens for ETH** (user sends us ETH and in return gets our real estate tokens)

*   You can **START/STOP** selling tokens at any moment \[only admin/owner can do this]

*   You can **BURN / WITHDRAW** unsold tokens \[only admin/owner can do this]

*   You can **change the price** of the token at any moment \[only admin/owner can do this]

*   You have to **establish token price** (for example: 1 token = $1)

\-

##### What else do we need for IPO?

**Multisig Wallet for IPO.** Why do we need it? The purpose of multisig wallets is to increase security by requiring multiple parties to agree on transactions before execution. Transactions can be executed only when confirmed by a predefined number of owners. 

Using a multisig wallet is essential to make an IPO. We can use an open source wallet like [Gnosis](https://gnosis.io/). It will be your company crypto wallet. 

\--

#### Right to share in profit. How to make profit distribution to stakeholders?

This is optional but I guess you would like to incentivize your investors to buy your tokens. If your property business annual ROI is 5% you can share this with your crypto investors. How? We will create another smart contract responsible for this operation. 

We want to pay a dividend only for people who bought tokens and keep them for at least a year (it might be also 3 or 6 months - up to your specific business case). We use one of the blockchain mechanisms - staking. Simply put, staking is the act of locking a token (or cryptocurrency) to receive rewards. We want to create a service to offer staking to our users. How does it work? As we mentioned - by creating a new smart contract (piece of code executing on the blockchain).

All stakeholders will have an option to stake tokens. It means that they have to transfer tokens to a smart contract address (like sending to the wallet). When they get the right to get a dividend then they will have the option to withdraw tokens plus dividend. There will also be another option for investors, which is to keep tokens in staking and withdraw only dividends.





#### **Tokenization platform - User Interface in Web application**&#xA;

What user (crypto investor) can do in the web portal:

*   Users will have the ability to buy tokens on IPO phase (set exact amount of tokens + secure ETH as a fee for paying the **gas**). 

*   Application will ask to connect with the user's crypto wallet (Metamask etc.)

*   User sees how much tokens bought (and the total amount of tokens user has)

<!---->

*   Stake tokens for dividend

*   Can withdraw tokens with the dividend (system shows the number of stacked tokens and the dividend available for payment)

As administrator you can do Start/Stop IPO, change the IPO price, pay dividend (in ETH). 

Some technicalities: App will be build in the testnet blockchain, deployed on the mainnet, verification will be done by etherscan.io 

We assume that in the first iteration of the platform you can add only one property for tokenization (one token creation).
