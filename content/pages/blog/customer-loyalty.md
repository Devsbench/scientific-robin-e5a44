**Non-fungible Tokens** are perhaps the most exciting innovation in crypto this year. For a deeper understanding of where the momentum is coming from, we have compiled a comprehensive report explaining what they are, how they work and why they are valuable.

In “Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs): Redefining Digital Scarcity” our team outlines why NFTs are more than just JPEGs or GIFs, how they empower online communities and why they are a technological breakthrough for content creators looking to build an economy with direct access to their consumers. 

While art and music appear to be the initial use cases for NFTs, they represent so much more. Many are sold as part of a limited collection, which buyers then use as a form of digital identity and affiliation with a community. Those NFTs can serve as a fundraising mechanism for the community who issued them and in turn reward members who bring the greatest value or reinvest the funds in future activities. 

Not only that, because an NFT is digitally scarce and verifiably authenticated on a blockchain, it can act as a passkey for exclusive content or an activity at the creator’s discretion. In addition, when the NFT is created via a smart contract, should the asset be continuously sold in the future, a portion of the proceeds can be returned to the creator in the form of a royalty.

In this article, you’ll also learn:

*   Why secondary markets are where most sales take place

*   How almost any intellectual property can be minted as an NFT

*   How to safely own and store the asset after your purchase

*   Concerns about NFT original work stored on centralized servers 

*   The role NFTs can play in online games

*   Who are the top creators and collectors of NFTs

## Introduction

The cryptocurrency space is always brimming with new technological advances, whether that be with token projects or blockchain applications. The latest buzz comes in the form of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). Celebrities, artists, billionaire entrepreneurs, and
athletes are seemingly tweeting about the excitement of NFTs, but what exactly are they? While the recent hype surrounds art or collectible NFTs, like NBA player Stephen Curry’s purchase of a zombie-eyed Bored Ape, their application and usability reach far beyond
static art or collectibles. NFTs are tokens that have introduced a new way to verifiably prove ownership of virtually anything through the blockchain. While a majority of the current NFTs come in the form of a JPEG or GIF, the sector is evolving such that the NFT itself becomes a means to an end. In other words, the ownership of a NFT can grant the owner the right and avenue to access data or a community directly.

NFTs reportedly recorded over $56M in sales in 2020 and over $927M in 1H2021 alone. This marks a 5,404% growth year-over-year when compared to 1H2020.4 While NFTs may sound foreign to many, the concept is fairly aged and rooted in the history of the crypto
industry. For a fuller understanding of NFTs, in this report we outline their purpose, background, current developments, and how they can be game-changing for those who believe in their application and potential. We also show how to participate in this sector, by including examples of where you can buy or mint a NFT. While we do provide examples, please note that it is not an endorsement of any specific NFT platform or the buying, minting, or selling of NFTs. As always, we strongly urge you to do thorough research before jumping in.

## Definition

**Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)** refer to digital assets that cannot be interchanged for another asset of the same type. Fungible assets can be substituted or exchanged for another asset of the same type, much like bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), and even fiat. They serve in place of what they are exchanged for; 1 bitcoin can be exchanged with another bitcoin, and both can be used in place of one another. Non-fungible assets, however, are unique and cannot be replaced. An example would be a one-of-a-kind original oil painting by an artist, like the Mona Lisa hanging in the Louvre. Multiple replicas can be printed and oil paintings can be recreated based on the original, yet nothing will ever replace the original. Similarly, NFTs are one-of-a-kind, digital representations of information or data where a holder has proof of ownership. NFTs and their corresponding ownership are recorded on the blockchain, which establishes NFTs verifiable digital scarcity and the uniqueness of each asset.

## Background

The concept of NFTs first came to be with Colored Coins in 2012, which could be used to represent real world assets on the Bitcoin blockchain and were made of small denominations of a bitcoin (BTC) known as satoshis.5 These coins could be used to represent anything—property, coupons, shares, subscriptions, and more. While Colored Coins exemplified a leap in the usage of Bitcoin’s blockchain, it was not as efficient as originally hoped as the Bitcoin network was not architected with NFTs in mind. The biggest flaw with Colored Coins was the fact that the system only worked in a permissioned environment, and served better as a database than anything else. However, it brought about a greater conversation around the potential of the blockchain in serving as a ledger for real-life assets. Another application of this concept came in the form of digitized memes. As the crypto industry rose to prominence in 2017 and the Ethereum network gained adoption, a NFT project focused on \*\*Pepe memes \*\*surfaced following the 2016 launch of Rare Pepe collectibles - Pepe-inspired NFTs minted on Bitcoin's Counterparty token protocol. The project, Peperium, was similar to the Rare Pepes Directory where Rare Pepe collectibles lived and was created to be a “decentralized meme marketplace and trading card game.”6 This project enabled the creation of memes that would live eternally
on the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS)7 and Ethereum. While interest in Pepe NFTs grew, a Rare Pepe on the Counterparty protocol known as "Homer Pepe" sold for a whopping $320K.8 After trading of Pepe NFTs picked up, two individuals named John Watkinson and Matt Hall created a NFT project famously known as Cryptopunks, which were unique 8-bit characters generated on the Ethereum blockchain. The project launched on June 23, 2017 with 10,000 unique Cryptopunk avatars available to anyone with an Ethereum wallet, for free. The underlying idea being that every character is unique, each avatar has its own distinct combination of characteristics and features, with 6,039 male Punks and 3,840 female Punks created. All 10,000 were claimed nearly a week after launch and began trading in a secondary marketplace.9 The creators, Hall and Watkinson, claimed 1,000 Punks for themselves.10 In the first three years of Cryptopunks (2017–2019), total sales volume was around $866K.11 As of writing, the most expensive Cryptopunk was sold at 4,200ETH ($7.6M equivalent) with highest daily sales volume reaching over $143M on August 28, 2021.

Cryptopunks follow the Ethereum Token Standard, which refers to the standard used for tokens to operate on the Ethereum blockchain. The most common framework is ERC-20, which stands for Ethereum Request for Comment (ERC) 20, and allows developers to create tokens that can interact with other tokens and network applications with ease. While ERC-20 tokens are useful, they are not best suited for creating unique tokens as they were created as standardized tokens that can be fungibly shared or exchanged for other tokens.

This led to the creation of ERC-721 and ERC-1155. ERC-721’s framework was first built as the standard for non-fungible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain by storing unique identifiers for every token to track ownership and movements of the tokens. Cryptopunks were something between an ERC-721 and ERC-20 token, as ERC-721 had not yet been invented. The first ever project to utilize the ERC-721 standard was CryptoKitties.

CryptoKitties took the world by storm in 2017 as its launch coincided with the crypto bull market of 2017. The NFT virtual game allows users to adopt, raise, and trade virtual cats on the blockchain. The project became so popular that, at its height, its overwhelming demand weighed on the Ethereum network and impacted its ability to efficiently process transactions on the blockchain. Roughly a month into its launch on November 28,2017, daily transaction count shot up 111% and the average transaction fee had risen by 1,165%. With the Ethereum network congested, the developers of the game raised prices to make the processing of the game’s transactions attractive to Ethereum network miners. Though a virtual game, the trade was no cheap thrill, with the most expensive CryptoKitty selling at the price of 600 ETH, or roughly $172,000 at the time of sale. The rise of CryptoKitties opened up a world of possibilities with NFTs, and led to several prominent venture funds such as Google Ventures (GV) and Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) investing into the booming sector.

CryptoKitties were blazing the trail and NFT marketplaces started to see notable growth. Marketplaces and infrastructure such as Nifty Gateway, SuperRare, Rarible, OpenSea all began to gain traction. Everything from game characters to event entrance tickets were traded as NFTs. Towards the end of 2020, the NFT marketplace started picking up steam in art and collectibles. By 1Q20, there were around 633K NFT sales, totaling a value of over $9M. By 4Q20, there were around 180K sales at a total value of over $20M.17 While the total number of sales dropped, NFTs were appreciating in value. In March 2021, a famous NFT artist known as Beeple, auctioned off his artwork named Everydays—The First 5000 Days. The starting bid was $100 and quickly sold for an astonishing $69M.18 This is the most expensive NFT art sold to date, and the third-most expensive art among all living artists.

In recent years, ERC-1155, also known as the Multi Token Standard, has become a popular standard for NFTs.20 This framework is designed to enable an infinite number of NFTs and fungible tokens in a single smart contract. This is an impressive leap from ERC-20 and ERC-721, both of which require a new smart contract deployed for each new class of tokens. With the right implementation, ERC-1155 significantly reduces gas fees when compared to ERC-721 tokens by allowing multiple tokens to be sent in one single transaction. This batching of transactions could offer significant savings in gas costs and shorten the time spent waiting for new blocks in recognizing single transfers. A common explanation given for the difference between ERC-721 tokens and ERC-1155 is the analogy of a vending machine. While ERC-1155 can hold an infinite variety of items in one vending machine (smart contract), ERC-721 requires one vending machine (smart contract) for each item created.

# ERC-721

**Benefits:** Similar to ERC-20 (most common/popular ERC standard) in functionality. This means it's easier for developers to make the transition to the ERC-721 standard, and easier for users to store the token in their normal wallets.

\*\*Limitations:\*\* A separate code, or smart contract, is required for each non-fungible token that is created. Each token transferred must be executed through a new, separate transaction. For instance, if 5 NFTs were to be transferred, there must be 5 different transactions executed. This would result in higher transaction fees and time.

# ERC-1155

One single smart contract can support different token types (e.g., fungible, semi-fungible, non- fungible). This results in lower computational overhead for applications or games that utilize different tokens. Developers can also deploy a single smart contract that is used indefinitely to mint new tokens, as it supports unlimited minting of all token types.
• A central smart contract will store the 'common code' that exists across all tokens, with a unique identifier that can be referenced by
all other smart contracts. This results in
smart contracts re-using the code from the central smart contract, in order to eliminate unnecessary repetition of codes. This reduces storage space and gas waste from processing the common code each time.
• It supports batch transfers, which is multiple types of tokens being transferred in a single transaction. This results in lower transaction costs alongside greater overall transaction speed and network efficiency.

While most of the current NFT market runs on the Ethereum blockchain, alternative layer 1 networks are competing for a greater share of the market. Solana and Cardano are among some of the networks that are competing with Ethereum-backed NFT marketplaces and expanding the NFT ecosystem. For instance, the Solana Foundation, in partnership with music platform Audius and NFT market builder Metaplex, announced the launch of a $5M Creator Fund to boost Solana’s NFT ecosystem.22 The fund was created to spur innovation on the network from artists, musicians, NFT projects, and metaverse builders. Similarly, Cardano is becoming a popular network on which to build a NFT marketplace. The Cardano network is scalable, interoperable, and enjoys relatively higher transaction speed with its Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism. Projects such as Cardano Kidz, Spacebudz, Professor Cardano, LoveADA, and Somint are among some of the projects created on Cardano that are quickly gaining traction and interest from the broader NFT user community. As the number of NFT projects grows and the diversity of blockchains underlying NFT platforms expands, it’s possible there will be a shift from Ethereum onto various different blockchains that are optimized for NFT capabilities.

# Value

At a glance, the value of NFTs may not be as clear, especially if the NFT has no immediate utility. For instance, art NFTs may seem to be nothing other than a digitized piece of art that can be exactly duplicated and owned. After all, if an individual buys the right to make legitimate copies of a digital art piece, what is then the value of the original digital art? While the value of a NFT may vary depending on the asset which the NFT represents, in the case of art or collectibles, we believe the value is derived from the status of originating ownership. While art pieces or visual collectibles may not have the most obvious or immediate physical utility, the ownership history or ownership status that is provable and immutable on a blockchain gives it value. In the long run, if art pieces trade hands and are passed on for generations, the latest owner will be able to prove the authenticity of the piece. This provable ownership can be applied not only to art pieces but also to goods that are protected with copyrights. Verifiable ownership is the main value driver for NFT collectors and users alike.

While the recent wave of NFTs has taken off with NFT art and collectibles, the application is truly endless and has far reaching implications with the digitized world we live in today. This is particularly the case as younger generations interact moreso online than offline. The notion of digital scarcity and digital identity is at the forefront of this generational shift, where people are learning to place value on digital identity and reputation more than ever before. This isn’t attributable solely to art or music becoming digitized, but even social interactions or personal thoughts jotted down on a blog or on Twitter. This is where the transformative power of NFTs and digital footprint takes hold at a macro level. With NFTs, a blockchain can track every interaction or connection to ever occur on digital content. This results in a direct connection between the creator of content with the user. This means that the intrinsic value of interaction is baked into the creation or content itself and individuals will begin to demand ownership of their digital content.

As it stands currently, platforms that connect creators to users have a monopoly on the content that is distributed. The users access a copy of the content, and the creators do not necessarily own the content themselves. Creators are no more than a renter of the content and users are granted permission to view the content in an app, which takes profit for the viewership. This leaves us with the realization—do creators actually own any of their digital content online? While the illusion of ownership makes it seem they do, the real answer is no. Media platforms reap profits from their users and content creators are paid less for the quality of their content and more for the attention, and the duration of the attention it can garner. Media platforms make significant profit from creators by retaining the distribution channels to disseminate content to a wider audience.

Under this hierarchy, creators are challenged to profit directly from their own creations. This is an example where NFTs can step in to create value. While current media outlets such as YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, and others have the ability to garner attention surrounding distributed content, there is a lack of claimed ownership or even scarcity. Imagine a NFT that can grant access to a TikTok video or Instagram post. Access is controlled by the NFT owner and/or creator of the content. Content creators will have the ability to generate direct revenue and the platforms acting as middlemen may cease to exist. Much like crypto, NFTs have the power to cut out third parties as value is programmed into the asset/content.
This leads us to the question - how would creators generate direct revenue? One way is through royalties. NFT royalties allow artists or content creators to receive a percentage of secondary sales. Each time a NFT is sold or changes hands, the smart contract will automatically trigger and execute royalty payments to the identified creator or author
of the work.23 While royalty systems can differ by platform, some marketplaces will allow the creator to choose the royalty percentage when minting the NFT. A 5%–10% cut of the sale is considered a standard payment.24 It should be noted that NFTs are not automatically royalty-yielding and terms must be clearly written into a smart contract should creators wish to receive a recurring cut of secondary sales. Creators also have
the option of selling a percentage of the underlying copyrights to an NFT, which would grant the buyer a portion of the royalties earned.25 This is the unique and unprecedented proposition offered by NFTs, where artists and creators can maximize earnings on their creations. While traditionally creators didn’t have a proper way to monetize their work post-initial sale, the NFT royalty system can generate perpetual returns especially with an increase in popularity of their work.

While conceptually, NFTs are game-changing and valuable because of the decentralized and permanent provable ownership of a service or product, it’s important to note that under the current ecosystem, many NFTs may be more centralized than imagined. Typically with NFTs, the token itself is stored on a blockchain (i.e., on-chain) but the corresponding content or art is stored off-chain due to the costs associated with storing large files on-chain. The artist or platform that mints the NFT gets to decide where the media and metadata related to the NFT is stored. If the artist chooses to store the media portion of the NFT on platforms or companies that maintain centralized servers, this could imply that buyers of a NFT run the risk of “losing” their NFT if these centralized platforms cease to exist and the token points to an off-chain dead link. While storing data off-chain in a centralized manner can increase flexibility for artists or creators that need to update metadata constantly (e.g., for in-game NFTs), it also carries ramifications on the long-term viability of NFTs. After all, what’s the value of the rights tied to a digital art piece that you can no longer see? To combat the risks of losing NFT metadata, minters, creators, and collectors should all take an active role in protecting and hosting their NFT-related data. As awareness of potential risks grows, platforms and projects are also seemingly taking an active stance and role in determining the responsibility tied to NFT-maintenance.26 Whether it’s familiarizing oneself with on-chain solutions that can truly make the NFT centralized by nature or utilizing services requiring ongoing data management, individuals should proceed with sustainability in mind.

# State of NFT

The NFT market currently enjoys a wide array of participants, both users and platforms flourishing with new applications of NFTs as the industry matures. While the boom in early-2021 mostly came in the form of art collectibles, the industry now sees a diverse mix of NFT product sales.
The current ecosystem is booming in a handful of sectors: gaming, sports, art, collectibles, metaverses, utility-driven NFTs, and more. Various NFT types exist within each sector. For instance in the art category, some NFTs take the form of video or static images. In collectibles, there may be generative NFTs27 or even dynamic NFTs.28 Sectors can also overlap, where an art NFT is purchased and displayed in a metaverse or game. Despite instances of overlap, each sector serves a unique purpose and market audience.
For example, NFTs in the domain of gaming generally represent in-game items. Purchasing a gaming NFT can offer ownership of in-game items with a range of benefits exclusively available to the players who own them. On the other hand, utility-driven NFTs, represent collectibles that carry real-life utility. Utility NFTs can be anything from an “access token” where NFT holders can tap into exclusive opportunities with creators and artists, to NFT-collateralized loans where NFT holders can put up their NFT as collateral for a loan. The applications are ever-expanding, and while there are countless players and sectors in the space today, below are some examples of key platforms by sector.

Looking to 2020, when sorted by sales count, the gaming sector came out on top with over 629K sales. In terms of sales value, the metaverse and art sector saw the highest value, with over $14M and $12M in sales, respectively.29 This suggests that higher value sales were made over fewer transactions for art and metaverses while the gaming industry saw more frequent sales at lower values. Looking to 2021, collectibles have seen the highest sales count and sales value at 1.1M sales and over $3.7B in sales, respectively. Trends across the metrics describe the growth in engagement and participation in NFT- related projects, and a shift in trends into NFT collectibles.

Beyond marketplaces and infrastructure platforms, wallets have also begun integrating NFT-related services in an attempt to make them more approachable for users. Wallets such as Metamask, Pillar, Alphawallet, and Argent are among those that have made it easier to trade and securely keep track of purchased NFTs alongside cryptoassets. Some crypto wallets are specifically designed or optimized for NFTs and have features enabled to allow for easier organization of NFTs held.
The NFT art frenzy of 2021 aided in the boom of NFT platforms and infrastructure as well as artists. Much like crypto transforming legacy financial markets, NFT art brought down barriers to the art world. Anyone with an art piece to offer can join NFT markets, which aren’t restricted to established artists. As a result, the industry saw a flurry of digital creators join the trade. At its height, as NFTs began expanding to other products such as collectibles, well-known celebrities also began creating and actively trading NFTs.



# Transformative power of NFTs

NFTs can theoretically have an endless application. Anything from physical products to cultural experiences to historical moments can be captured into a token in the current static form and eventually a dynamic NFT.47 With verifiable ownership on the blockchain, participants can have universally recognized ownership of a purchase. This level of assurance and guarantee awarded to an owner of a NFT has the potential to make markets more transparent. In addition, given the expansion of marketplaces and UX improvements for NFT apps, the barrier to entry is becoming lower and more accessible to global participants.

The industry continues to break new ground and go mainstream, with platforms like Twitter pursuing NFT authentication support through badges that would mark users’ NFTs as authentic.48 Yet many still worry about the future of the NFT market. Is it a gold rush? Or is it here to stay? We look at the pros and cons of NFTs as it stands today, to consolidate the perspectives of both skeptics and believers in the space.


					

## **Pros and Cons of NFTs&#xA;**

**Pros**

*   Intellectual property: creators and/or owners of a
    NFT can protect and claim their work in a way that
    is globally recognizable; creators will be credited
    every time their work is utilized.


<!---->

*   Level playing field: creators have a lower barrier to
    entry for artwork with no distinct market or artists
    with less opportunities for exposure. In other
    words, niche interests or sectors can easily gain a
    following or community. Creators also often have
    the benefit of payment (% of sale) every time the
    NFT is sold and re-sold (ie. NFT art).


*   Verifiable ownership: creators and/or holders of
    NFTs can claim irrefutable ownership backed by
    the blockchain.


**Cons
**

*   Practicality: Physical art vs. digital art—with
    digitized artwork, the copy is identical to
    the original. This raises the question of the
    usefulness and value of owning a NFT.


*   Value erosion from duplicates: a creator can
    choose to sell more than one copy of the exact
    same NFT without a limit on total number
    created and distributed.


*   Hype-based market: the value of a NFT is in the
    eye of the beholder(s). New or current wave of
    entrants could deem a NFT unvaluable and the
    market could quickly dwindle.


*   Regulatory uncertainty: current regulatory
    and legal environments are not designed

    to accommodate NFTs. As commercial and
    individual interests leads to greater exploration
    of the space, it is yet unclear how/if NFTs will
    be classified and what obligations will follow for
    owning a NFT.
