**Non-fungible Tokens** are perhaps the most exciting innovation in crypto this year. For a deeper understanding of where the momentum is coming from, we have compiled a comprehensive report explaining what they are, how they work and why they are valuable.

In “Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs): Redefining Digital Scarcity” our team outlines why NFTs are more than just JPEGs or GIFs, how they empower online communities and why they are a technological breakthrough for content creators looking to build an economy with direct access to their consumers. 

While art and music appear to be the initial use cases for NFTs, they represent so much more. Many are sold as part of a limited collection, which buyers then use as a form of digital identity and affiliation with a community. Those NFTs can serve as a fundraising mechanism for the community who issued them and in turn reward members who bring the greatest value or reinvest the funds in future activities. 

Not only that, because an NFT is digitally scarce and verifiably authenticated on a blockchain, it can act as a passkey for exclusive content or an activity at the creator’s discretion. In addition, when the NFT is created via a smart contract, should the asset be continuously sold in the future, a portion of the proceeds can be returned to the creator in the form of a royalty.

In this article, you’ll also learn:

*   Why secondary markets are where most sales take place

*   How almost any intellectual property can be minted as an NFT

*   How to safely own and store the asset after your purchase

*   Concerns about NFT original work stored on centralized servers 

*   The role NFTs can play in online games

*   Who are the top creators and collectors of NFTs

## Introduction

The cryptocurrency space is always brimming with new technological advances, whether that be with token projects or blockchain applications. The latest buzz comes in the form of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). Celebrities, artists, billionaire entrepreneurs, and
athletes are seemingly tweeting about the excitement of NFTs, but what exactly are they? While the recent hype surrounds art or collectible NFTs, like NBA player Stephen Curry’s purchase of a zombie-eyed Bored Ape, their application and usability reach far beyond
static art or collectibles. NFTs are tokens that have introduced a new way to verifiably prove ownership of virtually anything through the blockchain. While a majority of the current NFTs come in the form of a JPEG or GIF, the sector is evolving such that the NFT itself becomes a means to an end. In other words, the ownership of a NFT can grant the owner the right and avenue to access data or a community directly.

NFTs reportedly recorded over $56M in sales in 2020 and over $927M in 1H2021 alone. This marks a 5,404% growth year-over-year when compared to 1H2020.4 While NFTs may sound foreign to many, the concept is fairly aged and rooted in the history of the crypto
industry. For a fuller understanding of NFTs, in this report we outline their purpose, background, current developments, and how they can be game-changing for those who believe in their application and potential. We also show how to participate in this sector, by including examples of where you can buy or mint a NFT. While we do provide examples, please note that it is not an endorsement of any specific NFT platform or the buying, minting, or selling of NFTs. As always, we strongly urge you to do thorough research before jumping in.

## Definition

**Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)** refer to digital assets that cannot be interchanged for another asset of the same type. Fungible assets can be substituted or exchanged for another asset of the same type, much like bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), and even fiat. They serve in place of what they are exchanged for; 1 bitcoin can be exchanged with another bitcoin, and both can be used in place of one another. Non-fungible assets, however, are unique and cannot be replaced. An example would be a one-of-a-kind original oil painting by an artist, like the Mona Lisa hanging in the Louvre. Multiple replicas can be printed and oil paintings can be recreated based on the original, yet nothing will ever replace the original. Similarly, NFTs are one-of-a-kind, digital representations of information or data where a holder has proof of ownership. NFTs and their corresponding ownership are recorded on the blockchain, which establishes NFTs verifiable digital scarcity and the uniqueness of each asset.

## Background

The concept of NFTs first came to be with Colored Coins in 2012, which could be used to represent real world assets on the Bitcoin blockchain and were made of small denominations of a bitcoin (BTC) known as satoshis.5 These coins could be used to represent anything—property, coupons, shares, subscriptions, and more. While Colored Coins exemplified a leap in the usage of Bitcoin’s blockchain, it was not as efficient as originally hoped as the Bitcoin network was not architected with NFTs in mind. The biggest flaw with Colored Coins was the fact that the system only worked in a permissioned environment, and served better as a database than anything else. However, it brought about a greater conversation around the potential of the blockchain in serving as a ledger for real-life assets. Another application of this concept came in the form of digitized memes. As the crypto industry rose to prominence in 2017 and the Ethereum network gained adoption, a NFT project focused on \*\*Pepe memes \*\*surfaced following the 2016 launch of Rare Pepe collectibles - Pepe-inspired NFTs minted on Bitcoin's Counterparty token protocol. The project, Peperium, was similar to the Rare Pepes Directory where Rare Pepe collectibles lived and was created to be a “decentralized meme marketplace and trading card game.”6 This project enabled the creation of memes that would live eternally
on the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS)7 and Ethereum. While interest in Pepe NFTs grew, a Rare Pepe on the Counterparty protocol known as "Homer Pepe" sold for a whopping $320K.8 After trading of Pepe NFTs picked up, two individuals named John Watkinson and Matt Hall created a NFT project famously known as Cryptopunks, which were unique 8-bit characters generated on the Ethereum blockchain. The project launched on June 23, 2017 with 10,000 unique Cryptopunk avatars available to anyone with an Ethereum wallet, for free. The underlying idea being that every character is unique, each avatar has its own distinct combination of characteristics and features, with 6,039 male Punks and 3,840 female Punks created. All 10,000 were claimed nearly a week after launch and began trading in a secondary marketplace.9 The creators, Hall and Watkinson, claimed 1,000 Punks for themselves.10 In the first three years of Cryptopunks (2017–2019), total sales volume was around $866K.11 As of writing, the most expensive Cryptopunk was sold at 4,200ETH ($7.6M equivalent) with highest daily sales volume reaching over $143M on August 28, 2021.
