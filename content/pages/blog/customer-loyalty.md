**Non-fungible Tokens** are perhaps the most exciting innovation in crypto this year. For a deeper understanding of where the momentum is coming from, we have compiled a comprehensive report explaining what they are, how they work and why they are valuable.

In “Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs): Redefining Digital Scarcity” our team outlines why NFTs are more than just JPEGs or GIFs, how they empower online communities and why they are a technological breakthrough for content creators looking to build an economy with direct access to their consumers. 

While art and music appear to be the initial use cases for NFTs, they represent so much more. Many are sold as part of a limited collection, which buyers then use as a form of digital identity and affiliation with a community. Those NFTs can serve as a fundraising mechanism for the community who issued them and in turn reward members who bring the greatest value or reinvest the funds in future activities. 

Not only that, because an NFT is digitally scarce and verifiably authenticated on a blockchain, it can act as a passkey for exclusive content or an activity at the creator’s discretion. In addition, when the NFT is created via a smart contract, should the asset be continuously sold in the future, a portion of the proceeds can be returned to the creator in the form of a royalty.

In this article, you’ll also learn:

*   Why secondary markets are where most sales take place

*   How almost any intellectual property can be minted as an NFT

*   How to safely own and store the asset after your purchase

*   Concerns about NFT original work stored on centralized servers 

*   The role NFTs can play in online games

*   Who are the top creators and collectors of NFTs

## Introduction

Aenean dui sem, sollicitudin non venenatis eget, gravida rutrum risus. Proin massa leo, convallis id orci at, convallis dignissim mi. Integer et arcu arcu. Sed tristique diam id elit iaculis accumsan. Donec vehicula libero nunc, quis dictum orci pharetra nec. Proin blandit pellentesque sapien et sodales. Phasellus convallis sapien venenatis semper iaculis. Curabitur commodo iaculis mi, nec gravida nunc pellentesque ac. Nullam ac felis est. Donec gravida arcu ipsum, ut pulvinar est scelerisque id. Duis lobortis ante eu ante volutpat, quis pharetra sapien mattis. Sed ex enim, accumsan ut volutpat a, consectetur iaculis urna. Donec tempus enim sed porta euismod.

The cryptocurrency space is always brimming with new technological advances, whether
that be with token projects or blockchain applications. The latest buzz comes in the
form of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). Celebrities, artists, billionaire entrepreneurs, and
athletes are seemingly tweeting about the excitement of NFTs,1,
2 but what exactly are they?
While the recent hype surrounds art or collectible NFTs, like NBA player Stephen Curry’s
purchase of a zombie-eyed Bored Ape, their application and usability reach far beyond
static art or collectibles. NFTs are tokens that have introduced a new way to verifiably
prove ownership of virtually anything through the blockchain. While a majority of the
current NFTs come in the form of a JPEG or GIF, the sector is evolving such that the NFT
itself becomes a means to an end. In other words, the ownership of a NFT can grant the
owner the right and avenue to access data or a community directly.
NFTs reportedly recorded over $56M in sales in 2020 and over $927M in 1H2021 alone.3
This marks a 5,404% growth year-over-year when compared to 1H2020.4 While NFTs may
sound foreign to many, the concept is fairly aged and rooted in the history of the crypto
industry. For a fuller understanding of NFTs, in this report we outline their purpose,
background, current developments, and how they can be game-changing for those who
believe in their application and potential. We also show how to participate in this sector,
by including examples of where you can buy or mint a NFT. While we do provide examples,
please note that it is not an endorsement of any specific NFT platform or the buying,
minting, or selling of NFTs. As always, we strongly urge you to do thorough research
before jumping in.
